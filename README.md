# Crazy7

This game has a pattern like tetris where blocks fall and pile up in 4 column. Each block has a number on it which is visible to the player. The main concept is if the sum of any column has a multiple of 7, the whole column will disappear and the sum will be added to your score. The number in each blocks are randomized and if any column exceed the top limit, the game will be over.

Image assets needed:

- blocks 0-7
- edges of the area where blocks can be placed
- box for the number coming up next

Sound assets needed:

- place block (normal)
- place block (clear column)
- move block between columns
